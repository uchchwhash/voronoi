* About
*voronoi* is a program to decompose the surface of the unit sphere
into Voronoi cells for a set of 'generators' on it, and to calculate
the areas of the resulting cells.

* Requirements
- [[https://www.scipy.org/][SciPy]]
- [[http://www.numpy.org/][NumPy]]
- [[http://jupyter.org/][Jupyter]]

* Documentation
HTML documentation for the program can be generated by running
~make -C docs html~ from the root folder (requires [[http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/][Sphinx]]).

* Prior art
This implementation was inspired by the wonderfully readable paper:

Renka, R. J. (1997), Algorithm 772: STRIPACK: Delaunay triangulation
and Voronoi diagram on the surface of a sphere,
/ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software/ 23(3), 416-434.

A more sophisticated implementation is detailed in:

Caroli, M., P. M. de Castro, S. Loriot, O. Rouiller, M. Teillaud, and C. Wormser (2010),
Robust and efficient Delaunay triangulations of points on or close to a sphere,
in /International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms/, 462-473, Springer.

Note that an implementation of Caroli /et al./ (2010) recently landed in SciPy 0.18.0.
This project preceeds that with a simpler algorithm which is perhaps a bit slower and
a bit less numerically stable but definitely easier to understand.
